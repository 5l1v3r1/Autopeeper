Description 
=========== 

A tool for fully headless screenshotting of web sites and web applications, can be run from a VPS or SSH interface.

***currently going through full re-write***

### Plan of Action
- Setup basic functionality to take URLs as input then output to a folder
- Generate output report in markdown/html
- Add other features: Plugin to Burp Suite, add potential to scan for web ports then output screenshots of live hosts, support SSL
