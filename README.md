=========== 

A tool for automation of screen shotting a list of URLs and outputing information about target hosts based upon headers and responses. 

Usage:

# Plans
- Integrate NMAP Parsing to take .xml and append ports to urls
- Output screencaps to usable xml format with jpegs in an images folder
- make fully headless to run on VPS or other servers
